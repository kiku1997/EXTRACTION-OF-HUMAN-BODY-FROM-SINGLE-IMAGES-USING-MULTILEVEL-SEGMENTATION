# EXTRACTION-OF-HUMAN-BODY-FROM-SINGLE-IMAGES-USING-MULTILEVEL-SEGMENTATION
Extraction of human bodies from single images from respective digital image has attained attention in recent times and wide range of research is carried on to meet the desired result. A novel approach for extraction of standing human bodies has proposed in this paper where the highly dimensional pose space, scene density, and various human appearances are handled in better way compared to conventional state of art methods. The proposed approach is classified into five different steps, face detection, multi level segmentation, skin detection, upper body segmentation and lower body segmentation respectively.
